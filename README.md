## For when only Phil puns Phil do!

Using strings of varied length can be very handy when developing robust UI feature; especially when having to account for possible translations.

Now you can do this with Phil puns!! I know right, Phils good! ðŸ¤¯

## Don't be afraid to catch Phils!

Got a Phil pun that's not in the array? Make a branch and open a PR!
This won't Phil itself!!

## Installation

```sh
npm install philer-text --save
```

or

```sh
yarn add philer-text
```

## Usage

```js
import philer from "philer-text";

const pun = philer();
```
